These .js es6+ files have been manually created, on version v1.0.0, independently from 
the typescript tsc compiler.
Use these .js files instead, with Electron, to render all GUI elements... in case you wanna uninstall 
typescript tsc compiler and not use the automatic .js files compiled through it.
These files will not be updated after v.1.0.0.
Starting from v2.0.0, only typescript .tsc files will be maintained, and, of course,
the respective .js files, automatically generated by the tsc compiler, used by Electron
to generate the GUI.
