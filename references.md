Uncaught ReferenceError: exports is not defined in filed generated by Typescript
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42497479/uncaught-referenceerror-exports-is-not-defined-in-filed-generated-by-typescript
For solving this TypeScript bug, just add '<script> var exports = {}; </script>' to the HTML that is rendered with the .js files containing 'exports.__esModule = true;', which result, in turn, from the use of ES6+ modules at the correspondent .ts files. TypeScript compiler shouldn't generate that line. While TypeScript compiler is not corrected regarding this issue, just add that additional script line at the html files, and the Electron-generated GUI will work fine. Use "module": "CommonJS" and a "target" greater or equal than 'es6' at tsconfig.json for being able to use ES6 modules.
